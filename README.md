# Smart-House-STM32CUBEMX-KEIL
A smart house simulation using Arm stm32f3discovery microcontroller.

## Features
- There is an alarm system which is trigerred when a move detected or the temprature rises too high
- There are 4 rooms that thier lights are controlled by buttons.
- We can activate and deactivate alarm system after entering password
- Change password
- Show live status of lights, temperature, date and time on LCD
- Turn lights on and off automatically based on time or LDR (light) sensor status
- Send Logs for every event using UART
- A windows form app to show and filter logs, show and edit lights status, change password, set date and time (using UART)
